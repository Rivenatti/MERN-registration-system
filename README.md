# MERN Registstration System

This full-stack web application was created with use of technologies listed below:

- BACKEND:
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JSON Web Token

- FRONTEND:
React, Redux, Material-UI

Application is a fully working registration system which allows user to: sign up on the page, sign in on the own account, display information about his/her account and delete the account. For security and user authentication I have used JSON Web Token which is stored in the browser's localstorage.
